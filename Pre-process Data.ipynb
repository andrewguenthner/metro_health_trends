    "# SMART Raw Data Pre-processing for Mental Health Trends Dashboard\n",
    "\n",
    "### Desired Product\n",
    "* Simplified CSV file with pre-computed statistical information for mental health trends dashboard\n",
    "\n",
    "### Rationale\n",
    "* Because the SMART dataset from the CDC is quite large, a responsive Javascript app needs to work with some information pre-computed.\n",
    "* As an expert in statistical analysis and data science, and the owner of the dashbaord, I am the best person to do the pre-computations\n",
    "* Building a reproducible pipeline for pre-processing now will make it much easier to maintain the dashboard"

    "## Requirements\n",
    "*  The standard Python 3.7 environment installed with conda, as well as Pandas (0.24.2) and SciPy (1.2.1)\n",
    "*  The file `mental_health_env.yml` provides the info for reproducing the environment on Windows 10\n",
    "*  The raw data should be in a file called `smart_raw_data.csv` in the same directory as this notebook.  \n",
    "*  The raw data can be downloaded from the Centers for Disease Control at:  https://chronicdata.cdc.gov/Behavioral-Risk-Factors/Behavioral-Risk-Factors-Selected-Metropolitan-Area/j32a-sa6u  (hit the \"Export\" button and choose the \"CSV\" file option (non-Excel)"
