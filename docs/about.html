            <h3>About the Data</h3>
        <p>
            The United States <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/" target="_blank">Centers for Disease Control</a> maintains a database of 
            <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/brfss/" target="_blank">behavioral health risk factors survey data</a>.  This data is freely available
            for <a href="https://chronicdata.cdc.gov/Behavioral-Risk-Factors/Behavioral-Risk-Factors-Selected-Metropolitan-Area/j32a-sa6u" target="_blank">
            download</a>.  Numerous <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/brfss/brfssprevalence/index.html" target="_blank">visualizations</a> are also available.
        </p>
        <p>
            Most geographic visualizations either capture current values on a chloropleth or heat map,
            or they capture trends using a line chart.  Sometimes, though, it is useful to
            see both the spatial and temporal trends in one graphic, which is why this 
            visualization tool was made.
        </p>
        <p>
            For this tool, ten specific indicators were chosen based on the recorded summary 
            of CDC BRFSS survey responses.  Eight of these indicators come directly from specific categories 
            directly computed by the CDC and made available as part of the data.
        </p>
        <p> 
            In addition, two new categories were used for this visualization.  For body mass index,
            the CDC uses a 5-category response that records overweight and obesity prevalence as 
            separate categories.  For this dataset, both categories were combined into a single
            overweight / obese category.
        </p>
        <p>
            The raw data tracks the portion of the population who have ever had their cholesterol checked, 
            and the portion of the population who have ever had their cholesterol checked *and* 
            been told that it was high.  For this visualization, the prevalence of
            high cholesterol was estimated simply by taking the fraction who had been told their
            cholesterol was high and dividing by the fraction of people ever tested.  Using this approach as a quantitaive estimate 
            implies that these two factors are independent, which may not be true.  As a qualitative indicator, though, 
            it seems reasonable.

            <h3>About the Trends</h3>
        <p>
            Trends in health indicators and behavioral risk factors are clearly important to 
            try and understand, but how can we visualize them easily?  For this tool, I chose a 
            categorization approach.  If you look at the data, you wll see that over 7 years, 
            the trends can be more complex than simply an increase or a decrease.  In Charlotte, NC 
            for instance, diabetes and overweight prevalences appear to have crept up steadily, 
            while the prevalence of smokers dropped in the last 3-4 years after holding steady 
            for the first 3-4 years.  You will also notice that the data has some noise, and 
            most year-to-year changes are well within the margin of error, so, with only 7 years 
            of data, complex time-series analysis is hard to justify.
        </p>
        <p>
            Ideally, what would be nice is to have something that goes a step beyond just a positive or 
            negative trend, something that could help identify the locales where more interesting changes 
            may be taking place.  To accomplish that, the positive and negative trends have been divided 
            into three sub-classes, "speeding up", "steady", and "slowing/reversing".  This was done by 
            comparing linear and quadratic time-series model fits.  For the linear cases, an analysis of variance 
            was performed based on the reported means and estimated variances of the data series.  Where ANOVA 
            indicated a change with a Type I error probability of 5% or less, the trend was classified as 
            positive (progress) or negative (decline) based on the difference in "best fit" values (using least squares regressio 
            with inverse variance weighting), and based on common assumptions about what constituted a 
            "healthy" change.  Specifically, increases in diabetes, hypertension, overweight/obesity, and 
            high blood cholesterol prevalence were "unhealthy", as were increases in alcohol consumption and smoking 
            prevalence.  When these trends are described with the term "decline", it means that they indicate a decline 
            in the health of the population, not that the prevalence itself is declining.  I have always tried to make this
            distinction clear in the visualizations.  Increases in physical activity, blood cholesterol screening, health insurance coverage, and
            self-reported general health were considered "healthy".  
        </p>
        <p>
            Once a trend was established as significant, the adjusted squared Pearson correlation coefficients for the 
            linear and quadratic time-dependent models were compared.  If the quadratic fit gave a higher adjusted R-squared, then the 
            absolute value of the estimated slope (vs. time) at the first and last year were compared.  A higher absolute 
            value of the slope was deemed "speeding up" (or "accelerating"), while a lower value was classified as "slowing/reversing".  Note 
            that speeding up vs. slowing down can be determined independently from whether or not a reversal is 
            indicated in the trend, but to keep things simple the slowing / reversing effects were lumped together 
            as described.  If the linear (in time) fit provided a higher adjusted R-squared, then the trend was classified as 
            improving or declining "steadily".  
        </p>
        <p>
            If the results on the "summary" page are examined, you will see that most trends tended to fall into the "steady" 
            category.  This is useful as it fulfills the purpose of pointing out what may be the more interesting trends.  For 
            instance, for smoking prevalence, out of almost 200 metro areas with a discernible trend, only 17 were classified as 
            "accelerating improvement / progress speeding up" while only two were classified as having a 
            "decline speeding up" / "accelerating decline".  A look at the map page will show that many of the 17 
            areas where progress has accelerated lately are in Kentucky, Tennessee, and the Carolinas -- which gives an 
            interesting insight into what may be a recently emerging health trend in the heart of tobacco country. (To see 
            this for yourself, click on almost any metro area, then find the graph for smoking -- click the "behaviors" 
            radio button if you don't see it -- then click on "compare trends", or, if you are quite unlucky and 
            chose one of the two out of about 250 metro areas where no smoking data is available, just click on a different 
            metro area and the graph will populate with data.)
        </p>
        <p>
            One of the two metro areas where the smoking trend is an "accelerating decline" is my former home of Akron, OH.  I will use 
            it to briefly mention some of the limitations of this visualization approach.  To find Akron, if you are not an 
            expert in geography, and you don't feel like reading all the tooltips, you could take a side trip to a map server, or 
            with the smoking trends still displayed, you could look click on one of the two darkest brown dots on the screen.  Hint:  Akron 
            is the harder dot to find, being obstructed on most screens by other nearby metros.  Alas, making the metro "dots" large enough to 
            click on easily makes a few of them more difficult to find if you are looking for one in particular.  Thus, a search box is a good 
            choice for a future feature.  If you do manage to look at the data for Akron, you will notice there are four data points for most 
            measures.  Four is an interesting number as it does allow for an adjusted R-squared comparison between linear and quadratic 
            models, but with only four points an L-,  U-,  or V-shaped pattern can happen by chance quite frequently, which means that a larger than normal 
            number of fits are misclassified as non-linear.  You'll notice quite a few trends in Akron classified as non-linear.  You may also 
            notice that the trends in smoking and alcohol consumption are quite similar, yet the smoking trend is classified as a 
            "decline (in health) speeding up" because the 2015 prevalence is slightly higher than the 2011 prevalence, while for alcohol use,
            the trend is merely "progress slowing/reversing" because the 2015 prevalence is slightly lower than the 2011 prevalence.  Thus, the 
            non-linear trends, although doing a good job of making the hunt for interesting data easier, need to be interpreted with more caution!

            <h3>About the Statistics</h3>
        <p>
            Please note that the statistical methods used here are reasonable choices 
            for "exploratory grade" analysis.  They are not "publication grade" and not 
            intended for publication and peer review (sometimes data can simply be informative 
            and -- academics, avert your eyes! -- fun).  
        </p>
        <p>
            The reason for the "exploratory" grade involve two simplifications made with the data. 
            First, the complex sample design used to get population estimates by CDC was not taken into 
            account.  When, for instance, it is reported that about 15% of respondents in Austin were 
            current smokers, this does not mean that 15% of survey respondents answered yes.  About 15% 
            answered yes, but then the CDC adjusted the proportion to take into account the characteristics 
            of the sample, in order to estimate what the responses would have been for a perfectly 
            representative sample.  If interested, pleae feel free to read all about it on the CDC 
            website.  
        </p>
        <p>
            What the above means for statistics is that the sampling errors are not what one would 
            normally calculate for a given number of responses.  In many cases, the CDC has helpfully 
            provided 95% confidence intervals, but from that we can only approximate the expected variance 
            in the measurements.  Which leads us to simplification #2:  for this analysis, the response data 
            is assumed to be normally distributed.  These data were collected from surveys, often with several
            hundred to several thousand responses, so the calculated variance in responses based on the 
            binomial distribution should be well-approximated by a normal distribution.  The complex sampling 
            design, however, may introduce unexpected features in the distribution.  If you want to do 
            publication-quality statistics, you should read the CDC's published papers (or ask them about it).  
        </p>
        <p> 
            Where this matters most is in the custom categories (overweight and high cholesterol prevalence).  
            For these categories, the error bars you see are 95% confidence intervals based on assumptions of normality as well 
            as independence of the component measurements and a disregard of the complex sampling design.  To see how much 
            this matters, I compared the CDC's own multi-category derived error estimates with ones I computed using 
            the above simplifications.  The results agreed within about 10%, but did not coincide perfectly.  Thus, the error 
            bars on those two categories should be treated as approximate.  Otherwise, the error bars correspond to 
            the 95% confidence limits reported by the CDC, and as long as you simply take them at face value and don't 
            try to further manipulate them for statistical purposes, they should be reliable.

            <h3>Thanks!</h3>
            <p>If you're still reading after all that, then you probably like data as much as I do.  So you may be 
                interested in knowing (fi you don't already) that the CDC is a great place to get your hands on clean, free 
                data sets that can be quite massive.  In addition to thanking them, I would also like to thank Michelle 
                Chandra, whose bl.ocks.org <a href="http://bl.ocks.org/michellechandra/0b2ce4923dc9b5809922" target="_blank">US map</a> 
                came in handy, as well as Trang Tran, whose <a href="https://github.com/ttdtrang/d3-colorbar" target="_blank">d3-colorbar</a> also 
                also added a nice touch. The GeoJSON source data (from the US census bureau) came via <a href="http://eric.clst.org/tech/usgeojson/" target="_blank">the 
                helpful site</a> by Eric Celeste, with some helpul hints from <a href="https://observablehq.com/@floledermann/drawing-maps-from-geodata-in-d3"
                target="_blank">a helpful article</a> by Florian Ledermann. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The data munging was done wtih Python3 in a Jupyter Notebook using Pandas, SciPy.stats and the linear regression models 
                from scikit-learn, and the visualization was done with a big chunk of d3.js (v5).  Hint:  pure d3 is great on 
                your own time because it will pay you back with better graphics skills, but if someone else is paying by the 
                hour, use Plotly.js if you can!  Finally, I couldn't have been good enough with these tools to consider doing 
                all this as a quick project without Danny Clifford and his fellow instructors at the UC Berkeley Data Analytics 
                program.  If you like Excel but would love to take it to the next level quickly, it's worth the effort!
            </p>
